# JumpVision

JumpVision is a machine vision-based project for estimating an individual's jump height and hang time from video footage. By analyzing videos captured from a fixed camera angle, the system can track key body points and use physics-based calculations to determine jump performance.

## Features
- üìπ **Video-based measurement**: Uses computer vision to analyze jump motion.
- üéØ **Accurate jump height estimation**: Calculates vertical leap based on body keypoint tracking.
- ‚è± **Hang time calculation**: Determines the total air time of the jump.
- üìä **Data visualization**: Plots motion curves and key parameters for better analysis.

## Installation
```sh
git clone https://github.com/SportsCV/JumpVision.git
cd JumpVision
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Usage
1.	Place a video file of a jump attempt in the project directory as `demo.mp4`.
2. Run the analysis script:
```shell
python main.py
```
3. View the output jump height and hang time.

## How It Works
1. Keypoint Detection: Uses a pose estimation model to track the ankle position.
2. Jump Segmentation: Filters the frames to extract the jump phase.
3. Parabolic Fitting: Applies a quadratic function to estimate jump height.
4. Physics-based Calculation: Computes the total hang time and vertical leap.
